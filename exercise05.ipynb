    "\n",
    "So, if we need some multi-track material, we can download one of the zip files. Below we use 4 examples that worked out very illustratively.\n",

    "To create a matrix where the columns represent the multi-tracked files (either the left channel, or the right channel or summed to a mono channel) we need equal length *.wav files to work with the code below (I was too lazy to program this nicely).\n",

    "- grabbing all multi-track files from a certain zip into an empty project\n",
    "- making them as separate tracks\n",
    "- choose an appropriate time selection\n",
    "- do some simple level mixing according to actual taste\n",
    "- selecting all tracks\n",
    "- open the `render to file` dialog\n",
    "    - choose Source: `Selected tracks (stems)`\n",

    "    - Directory: create a `multi-track` folder as subfolder where the raw wav files are stored\n",
    "    - File name: `multi-track`\n",
    "    - make sure that original sampling rate is used\n",
    "    - Format: `Wav`\n",
    "    - WAV bit depth: `32 Bit FP` (uses more storage, but then we don't need to pay attention to numbers larger/smaller than 1 if some mixing was performed)\n",
    "    - click `Dry Run (no output`)\n",
    "    - check if this simulated rendering comes with the expected channels into the expected number of files with naming convention `multi_track-xxx.wav`\n",
    "    - we are ready to render by clicking `Render xxx files``\n",
