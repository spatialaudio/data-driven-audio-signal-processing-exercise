    "So, we actually expect two numbers, 0 and 1, as model output. However, the linear activation yields real numbers as model output, which in the optimum case are 0 and 1, but for not optimum trained models they might be very close to 0 and 1 or even completely 'wrong'. So, the model needs to be trained exactly to the above given weights, to have the intended binary classification characteristics.\n",
