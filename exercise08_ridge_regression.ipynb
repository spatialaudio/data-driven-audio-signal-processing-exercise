    "\n",
    "This notebook gains most fun, if we have multi-track audio to work with, ideally on our own computer. Maybe we even have some own recorded multi-tracked music ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get some nice multi-track audio material from [https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) .\n",
    "\n",
    "This data base supports Mike Senior's 2nd edition of the book \"[The Mixing Secrets For The Small Studio](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/main/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The data base is provided for educational purpose and we will use it precisely this way...learning linear regression and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we need some multi-track material, we can download one of the zip files. Below we use 4 examples that worked out very illustratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a matrix where the columns represent the multi-tracked files (either the left channel, or the right channel or summed to a mono channel) we need equal length *.wav files to work with the code below (I was too lazy to program this nicely).\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable work flow is to use a digital audio workstation (DAW) software, such as [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/purchase.php) (please support these guys, non-commercial license is very cheap).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reaper we would do:\n",
    "- grabbing all multi-track files from a certain zip into an empty project\n",
    "- making them as separate tracks\n",
    "- choose an appropriate time selection\n",
    "- do some simple level mixing according to actual taste\n",
    "- selecting all tracks\n",
    "- open the `render to file` dialog\n",
    "    - choose Source: `Selected tracks (stems)`\n",
    "    - choose Bounds: `Time selection`\n",
    "    - Directory: create a `multi-track` folder as subfolder where the raw wav files are stored\n",
    "    - File name: `multi-track`\n",
    "    - make sure that original sampling rate is used\n",
    "    - Format: `Wav`\n",
    "    - WAV bit depth: `32 Bit FP` (uses more storage, but then we don't need to pay attention to numbers larger/smaller than 1 if some mixing was performed)\n",
    "    - click `Dry Run (no output`)\n",
    "    - check if this simulated rendering comes with the expected channels into the expected number of files with naming convention `multi_track-xxx.wav`\n",
    "    - we are ready to render by clicking `Render xxx files``\n",
    "- maybe it's a good idea to save this Reaper project for further reference "
