    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook gains most fun, if we have multitrack audio to work with, ideally on our own computer, even more ideally we have some own recorded music ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get some nice multitrack audio material from [https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/) .\n",
    "\n",
    "This data base supports Mike Senior's 2nd edition of the book \"[The Mixing Secrets For The Small Studio](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/main/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The data base is provided for educational purpose and we will use it precisely this way...maybe in slightly different mixing approach than initially intended, but we will doing a mixing job here...using the SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we need some multitrack material, we can download one of the zip files. Below we use 4 examples that worked out very illustratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a matrix where the columns represent the multitrack files (either the left or right channel or summed to mono) we need equal length wav files to work with the code below (I was too lazy to program this nicely).\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable workflow is to use a digital audio workstaion (DAW) software, such as [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/purchase.php) (please support these guys, non-commercial license is very cheap).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reaper we would do:\n",
    "- grabbing all multitrack files from a certain zip into an empty project\n",
    "- making them separate tracks\n",
    "- choose an appropriate time selection\n",
    "- do some simple level mixing accroding to actual taste\n",
    "- selecting all tracks\n",
    "- open the `render to file` dialog\n",
    "    - choose Source: `Selected tracks (stems)`\n",
    "    - choose Bounds: `Time selection`\n",
    "    - Directory: create a `multi-track` folder as subfolder where the raw wav files are stored\n",
    "    - File name: `multi-track`\n",
    "    - make sure that original sampling rate is used\n",
    "    - Format: `Wav`\n",
    "    - WAV bit depth: `32 Bit FP` (uses more storage, but then we don't need to pay attention to numbers larger/smaller than 1 if some mixing was performed)\n",
    "    - check `Dry Run (no output`)\n",
    "    - if this simulated rendering comes with the expected channels into the expected number of files with naming convenntion `multi_track-xxx.wav`\n",
    "    - we are ready to render using `Render xxx files``\n",
    "- maybe it's a good idea to save this project for further reference, such as checking what different mixes do to the SVD data...\n",
